this is the dev environment that i use for developing.

- in Vagrantfile you can find the settings for the VM 
- I mount ./project folder to a folder inside the vm so that all the project code is persisted to my local machine
- the provision.sh script is used to install software while creating a new VM,
    in here you can find functions for all the software used in this repo.
